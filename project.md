# OIM3690 Web Technologies - Term Project (subject to changes)

# What is the Term Project?

The term project requires you to conceptualize, design, and implement a website. This is an individual effort.

The website must be published using following hosts:
1. GitHub project repository
2. (Optional) External web host or cloud service (if you want to use backend programs, i.e. PHP or Python.) It is important that the web hosting service must provide ad-free service.

You will be required to
1. purchase/acquire a domain
2. (optional) use web hosting service. You can
     - pay a hosting fee for the service such as GoDaddy or BlueHost, which is total to about $10-$30
     - or use (free) cloud service such as Heroku, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform, or DigitalOcean.

The Term Project is an individual assignment that will be developed in multiple stages throughout the term, with final submission due on the last day of class. Intermediate stages must be submitted on their respective due dates and will be graded. Late submissions will incur a penalty of 5 points per day. Extensions may be granted by the instructor if a request is made before the due date. All deliverables are mandatory and must be submitted, regardless of timeliness.

# Examples of Term Project:

Your term project website may be based on any topic that conforms to [Babson's Policy on Terms of Use](https://www.babson.edu/terms-of-use/). This course focuses on browser-side development and does not cover databases, back-end frameworks and applications, or e-commerce. However, you can design their website in a way that can later be extended to support these features. Some examples of potential website topics include:

1. A travel website dedicated to providing information about Hong Kong and its attractions, including night-life, dining options, sites to see, weather, fashion, and a currency converter.
2. A website for a family-owned interior design business, featuring a portfolio of completed projects, artwork for sale, and decorating ideas.
3. A website for a business that makes and sells clothing and accessories made from recycled products, including a catalog of products and information about the production process.
4. A website dedicated to the Boston Red Sox baseball team, including video links to memorable moments in the team's history.
5. A website for a Babson student organization that helps international students improve their logical, analytical and persuasive skills, featuring information about events, the executive board and how to become a member.
6. A website dedicated to the life and inventions of Enzo Ferrari.
7. A website featuring a student's personal account of a study-abroad trip to Italy, including pictures, experiences, and places to visit.


It's important to note that the above examples are just suggestions and you are free to choose a topic of their choice.
